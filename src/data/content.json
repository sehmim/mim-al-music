The result is a song that refuses to be ignored—loud, intense, and unapologetically alive.",

From the primal hook repeating \"fucked up, lucked out\" to verses that explore the highs of ambition and the lows of destructive cycles, it captures the chaos of modern life with brutal honesty. Adding to the chaos is a blazing guitar solo and an unexpected yet powerful saxophone performance by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nath_biss_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:text-secondary transition-colors underline\">Nathan Bissonette</a>, giving the track an edge that's both chaotic and strangely elegant.",
